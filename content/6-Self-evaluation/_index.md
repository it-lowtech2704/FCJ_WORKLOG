Throughout my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd**. from September 6, 2025 to December 24, 2025, I had the opportunity to learn, train, and apply the knowledge gained in university to a real-world working environment.

I participated in the development of a project with my team—a web application designed as a reference and sharing platform for users to document their journeys across various locations and spaces globally. This project leveraged AWS serverless services to enhance user experience and transition the web application from a local setup to a production environment for widespread sharing. Through this process, I improved my programming skills, adapted to a new language, gained a better understanding of the pros and cons of different AWS services, learned how to deploy a web application to a new, public environment, and developed teamwork skills essential for collaborative product development.

Regarding professional conduct, I consistently strived to complete tasks effectively, adhere to regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues to improve work efficiency. I maintained a positive and friendly attitude with my teammates to ensure the successful completion of the project.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
