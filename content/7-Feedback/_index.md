## Introduction

After a truly memorable internship at FCJ, I feel incredibly fortunate and want to express my heartfelt thanks. This journey was not just about work, but a series of joyful learning experiences. I would like to share some thoughts and small suggestions, hoping they will be helpful for FCJ!

## Overall Assessment

### 1. Work Environment

Honestly, the environment at FCJ is what I loved the most. Everyone is incredibly friendly and open, and I never once felt out of place. Even when asking the most "naive" questions, I always received enthusiastic support, sometimes even outside of work hours. The neat, super comfortable workspace also helped me get into the 'flow' much faster!

### 2. Mentor Support

I am truly grateful to my Mentor for the patience and detail in every guidance session. What I valued most is that the Mentor always gave me the opportunity to try and solve problems myself. Instead of providing the answer, the Mentor taught me how to find it. That is the most precious lesson!

The mentor team is super nice, providing quick support with procedures, creating all the conditions for an intern like me to feel secure in my work. With the active support from the mentors and the workshops, my team was able to quickly complete the project and successfully deploy it.

### 3. Alignment between Work and Academic Major

The assigned work had a close connection to the knowledge I learned at university. More importantly, I got to approach new areas and practical skills that textbooks haven't yet covered. Thanks to this, I both strengthened my foundation and "levelled up" my practical skills. Particularly, in cloud skills, infrastructure, and AWS services, along with responsible teamwork with everyone in the team.

### 4. Opportunity for Learning & Skill Development

This period helped me "pocket" a lot of new skills: from using professional project management tools, collaboration skills, to professional communication in a corporate setting. The practical experience sharing from the Mentor and everyone served as a compass, helping me define a better direction for my future career.

### 5. Culture & Team Spirit

FCJ's culture is excellent: respectful, professional yet never dull. Especially when there was a pressing project, everyone worked together, providing support regardless of position. The feeling of being part of the collective, contributing even as a member of the FCJ community, is truly meaningful!

### 6. Intern Policies / Benefits

I really appreciate the flexibility regarding work hours when needed. Being able to participate in the workshops (sharing knowledge and skills) is a huge plus, helping community members feel invested in and developed seriously.

## Other Questions

### What was the most satisfying thing during your internship?

The most satisfying thing: Definitely the company culture and the excellent support from the Mentor/Team. This is the decisive factor for an FCJ member to grow and feel committed.

### What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?

Perhaps adding more WORKSHOPS so members can better understand the learning roadmap, exchange ideas, and timely supplement knowledge to keep up with project progress.

### If you were to recommend it to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?

**Absolutely YES!** Because this is a place where you get to challenge yourself and learn from A-Z seriously, instead of just doing simple administrative tasks. The friendly environment and the support from the senior members are hard to find elsewhere.

## Suggestions & Aspirations

### Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?

I suggest considering setting aside a small "budget" for **Team Lunch/Team Bonding periodically (monthly)** so everyone has a chance to relax and bond more.

### Do you want to continue this program in the future?

I **very much hope** to have the opportunity to continue accompanying, contributing, and developing with FCJ in the future, if a suitable position is available, and I hope I can contribute to developing the next generations of the community.

### Other Feedback (free sharing)

I genuinely thank FCJ for creating such a meaningful and valuable internship program. This is not just a workplace but also a place where I matured significantly. I hope the company's internship program will continue to grow, helping many other young people have an experience as wonderful as mine.

**Thank you FCJ once again for everything! Wishing the company/community continuous strong development!**
