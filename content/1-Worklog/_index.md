This page documents the entire **Worklog** carried out throughout the **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** internship program. This document details the process of learning, implementing the **Travel-Guided** project, troubleshooting system errors, and participating in specialized events over **12 weeks** (approximately 3 months).

During these 12 weeks, I transitioned from familiarizing myself with core Cloud concepts to building and optimizing a complete Serverless application on AWS.
