### Week 3 Achievements

- Successfully created a new AWS account with initial configurations, ensuring continued participation with the FCJ team.
- Gained a solid understanding of Route 53 and Hybrid DNS configuration:
  - Created and configured Outbound Endpoint for Route 53 Resolver.
  - Set up Route 53 Resolver and Inbound Endpoints.
  - Successfully connected to RD Gateway Server during practical exercises.
- Mastered VPC Peering, enabling private communication between VPCs within the same AWS Cloud without traversing the public internet.
- Learned to create AWS resources using CloudFormation templates.
- Successfully enabled Cross-Zone and Cross-Region DNS Resolution in VPC Peering, allowing EC2 instances in different VPCs to resolve private IP addresses via DNS.
  - Understood that without this feature, DNS queries return public IPs, causing traffic to route through the internet.
- Participated in a team meeting, finalized the programming language for the project, and set deadlines for team members to further study the chosen language.
